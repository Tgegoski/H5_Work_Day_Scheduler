# 05 Work Day Scheduler

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.  The color of each block of time changes to show whether it is past, present, or future. This application uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  It also utilizes the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to be able to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
When I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the page. 
When I scroll down I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. 
When I view the timeblocks for that day each one is color coded to show whether it is in the past, 
present or future.
When I click on a timeblock I can enter an event. 
When I click on the save button for that timeblock,
then the text is saved to local storage.
When I refresh the page then the event is still displayed.

## Challenges

Had a good deal of difficulty getting the color blocks for past, present, and future events to work properly. 
Also had issues getting the text to save to local storage.
